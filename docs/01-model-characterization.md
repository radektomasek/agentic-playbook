# Chapter 1: Model Characterization

In this chapter, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be categorized â€” especially in the context of agentic systems. Not all LLMs are created equal, and understanding their capabilities helps us choose the right model for the right task.

## Reasoning vs. Direct Generation

A useful high-level separation is based on **how the model handles thinking**:

### ğŸ§  Reasoning Models ("Think Before You Do")

These models are capable of step-by-step reasoning, decision-making, and self-reflection. They are typically used in agentic or multi-turn workflows where the LLM needs to plan, adapt, and coordinate.

**Characteristics:**

- Support multi-step reasoning (e.g., `Chain-of-Thought`).
- Can decide which tools to use.
- Capable of planning, revising, and reflecting.
- Often used with agent frameworks like `CrewAI` or `LangGraph`.

**Examples:**

- GPT-4 (especially Turbo)
- Claude 3 Opus
- Gemini 1.5 Pro
- Mistral Medium

**Best for:**

- Agents that plan tasks.
- Dynamic tool usage.
- Reflection and retry loops.
- Multi-agent communication.

### âš¡ Direct Generators ("Just Do the Thing")

These models are optimized for fast output and are often used in situations where **raw throughput** and **latency** matter more than deep reasoning. Ideal for completion-based tasks.

**Characteristics:**

- High-speed, low-latency.
- Excellent at code or text generation.
- Less context-aware or reflective.
- Often used in IDEs or simple prompt-driven interfaces.

**Examples:**

- Code Llama
- StarCoder
- DeepSeekCoder
- GPT-3.5 Turbo
- Claude 3 Sonnet / Haiku

**Best for:**

- Code completion
- Auto-reply generation
- Simple transformations
- Filling in structured templates

## Thinking Patterns in Agentic Systems

### ğŸ§  ReAct = *Reasoning and Acting*

> Introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629), ReAct is a method where LLMs interleave **thinking** and **tool use**.

A ReAct-style agent follows a loop like:

1. **Thinks** ("I need to check the weather")
2. **Acts** (calls the weather API)
3. **Observes** the response
4. **Thinks again**, and so on

Useful in agents that need to reflect, adapt, and coordinate their actions based on observations.

### ğŸ§  CoT = *Chain of Thought*

> A prompting method where the LLM is **encouraged to explain its reasoning step by step** before giving an answer.

```text
Q: If I have 3 apples and buy 2 more, how many do I have?
A: Let's think step by step.
- I start with 3 apples.
- I buy 2 more.
- 3 + 2 = 5.
Answer: 5
```

CoT is often used *within* other agent patterns to increase accuracy and clarity in reasoning-heavy tasks.

| Task Type         | Ideal Model Type         | Examples                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Code completion   | Direct generator          | StarCoder, Code Llama     |
| Plan itinerary    | Reasoning agent           | GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus      |
| Answer from docs  | Hybrid (RAG + reasoning)  | Claude, Gemini 1.5        |
| UI fill-in        | Direct + fast             | GPT-3.5, Claude Haiku     |
| Long-context eval | Reasoning + memory        | Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude Opus |

## Note: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

> Many agentic systems combine LLM reasoning with **retrieval** mechanisms to access external information. 
This is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

Instead of relying solely on the LLM's internal knowledge, an agent can:

- Formulate a query
- Retrieve documents from a database or knowledge store
- Reason using the retrieved context

In agentic workflows, RAG is often the first step before tool usage or decision-making.

> ğŸ§  We'll cover RAG patterns and their integration into agentic systems more deeply in a later chapter.
